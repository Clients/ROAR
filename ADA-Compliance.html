How we build Accessibility Driven Website

Screen Resolution

This website is designed to respond to the size of your screen. Resize your browser to the size that best suits your needs.

Text Contrast

All text on this site has been created to have a contrast ratio over its background of over 4.5:1. This adheres to W3C Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 level AA.

Images

All content images on this site are provided with descriptive ALT attributes. Graphics that are purely decorative in function have empty ALT attributes, to prevent them from displaying on screen readers.

Navigation

All pages contain a link to the home page, sitemap and search box. The primary navigation has been built in a consistent fashion to provide clear navigation throughout the site. Secondary navigation is provided for way-finding through individual sections of the site.

Links

Links have been written to make sense out of context, title tags or spans of text only visible to screen readers have been used to expand on the meaning of short links.
